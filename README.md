# Allure TestOps version 5, configuration files for docker compose installation

## Configuration sets

1. testops-demo
2. testops
3. testops-ldap
4. testops-saml

### testops-demo

Config `testops-demo` **cannot be used** as production deployment. Use this as a proof of concept or demo for the decision making.

Demo config contains all the components required for the starting Allure TestOps up, however this configuration requires a lot of maintenance and will lead to significant downtime and possible data loss when database upgrade is required.

We won't be able to help with data restoration or performance issues when Allure TestOps is deployed with demo config.

### testops

Use this configuration if you are going to manage end users and their authentication via Allure TestOps UI (so-called local users or system authentication).
